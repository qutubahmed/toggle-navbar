A toggle navbar is a navigation bar that can be expanded or collapsed with a button, commonly used in responsive web design to optimize space on smaller screens.
 When the toggle button (usually represented by three horizontal bars, also known as a "hamburger" icon) is clicked, the navigation links are displayed, allowing users to easily access different sections of the website.
Implementing a toggle navbar typically involves using HTML to structure the navbar, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to handle the toggle functionality. 
This enhances user experience by providing a clean and accessible navigation system on both desktop and mobile devices.
